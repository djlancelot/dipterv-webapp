        SensorMonit is a web application for browsing SOS services. It is using a Stardog based RDF store to retrieve
        the semantic connection between sensors. Using the sensor browser you can filter for sensor categories.</p>
      <p>
        You can choose a sensor to display its data. The system automatically displays the numeric boolean and text
        observations of a sensor and its geographical coordinates. The types are stored in the RDF database.
